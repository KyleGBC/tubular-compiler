## Tubular->WASM Compiler
# Overview
This toy compiler was created as part of the CSE 450: Translation of Programming Languages at Michigan State University.
It implements the Tubular toy language specification created for the course, and compiles to WAT (WebAssemblyText).
The lexer is autogenerated by [Emplex](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse450/Emplex.html "Emplex: A C++ Lexer Generator").


# Supported features
 - Control Flow: Functions, if-(else-)statements, while-statements, returns, breaks, and continues
 - Types: string\*, int (32-bit), char
 - Operations: Assignment, casting, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, modulus, comparisons, and logical operators
 - Error reporting  

# Syntax
Check out the tests for examples of Tubular syntax

\* Strings are implemented, but in order to pass them to a Tubular function from JavaScript, or returned from a Tubular function to Javascript, they must be coordinated properly in memory.
